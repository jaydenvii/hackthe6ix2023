## Inspiration
The inspiration behind FyLy came from how cluttered and disorganized our folders (and many others) are. This disarray and a touch of laziness led us to this idea: to let AI do the heavy lifting and enjoy a more organized life.

## What it does
FyLy is an AI-powered digital file organizer designed to put you in control of your files. By using our streamlined command line interface you quickly put your messy desktop back in shape. After the organization, you can upload the generated .csv file to see exact stats on your files.

## How we built it
We built FyLy using Python Click for the terminal interface, Taipy for the data analytics, and OpenAI API for organizing the files.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was having to make a last-minute decision to switch to being a console app after we discovered we could not manipulate files to the degree we needed with a cloud setup.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The accomplishment we are most proud of is our ability to make a last-minute pivot, and quickly adapt to new technology to keep our core idea intact.

## What we learned
During the creation of FyLy, we learned how to use unfamiliar technologies like Python Click and Taipy. Most importantly we learned to think out every step of our project ahead of time, to avoid unprecedented circumstances like we did with FyLy.

## What's next for FyLy
We would love to revisit the web app approach we originally came in with since it will allow for a cleaner design and a more accessible UX.
